### Principles:

- SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- OCP (Open Closed Principle)

### Miscellaneous Learnings:

- names of functions/variables should tell me everything
- functions should do one thing and they should do it well
- functions should have a constant level of abstraction, they should not be mixed like low level .append and high level like getHTML()
- functions should be max 20 lines long
